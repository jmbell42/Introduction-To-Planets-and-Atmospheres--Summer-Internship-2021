# Introduction-To-Planets-and-Atmospheres--Summer-Internship-2021
This contains some courses and notes/lectures for planetary atmospheres and space weather.  These are mostly graduate level courses, but they should be okay for most people to take a look at.


The Lectures Directory are a series of powerpoint slides from a Graduate Course on Planetary Science taught at the University of Texas.  The main items to focus on are the atmosphere parts for an introduction to the atmosphere of planets.

The Thesis Directory is a short version of Jared's Thesis.  The first chapter is (hopefully) a decent introduction to atmospheres. Chapter 2 describes the mathematics that we use to simulate these atmospheres (don't let the amount overwhelm you... no need to fully understand this stuff, but just get a feel for the types of equations and the types of equations (Continuity, momentum, and Energy).   Part III delves into the nuts and bolts of how we actually start to solve the equations in Part II.  Again, don't sweat the details just a general familiarity is all you need. 

The Tutorial Directory is an introduction to the Upper Atmosphere that I (Jared) developed for the SESI program.  

Recommended Order:

1.  Begin with the Tutorial
2.  Grab the Lectures and go through the first few 2.1 - 2.5
3.  Check out the thesis Chapters 1, 2, and (maybe) III.  But at least I should be okay.

More to come!
